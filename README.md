# Qt Linguist

Qt Linguist is a translation tool for translators. This version supports XLIFF files generated by Xcode.

This project is intended to use Qt Linguist as an XLIFF editor, for translating Xcode localization files on a different platform. Converting between XLIFF (.xliff) and other file formats (.ts, .po, .xlf) is not encouraged, since the data models are not fully compatible.
